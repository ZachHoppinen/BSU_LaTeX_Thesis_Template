# BSU_LaTeX_Thesis_Template

This is LaTeX2e template for the Boise State University (BSU) Graduate Thesis. You can also find a version of this template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/boise-state-university-ms-thesis-and-phd-dissertation-template/fbvbtvfnpvvb).

BSU has a thesis and dissertation page with helpful information [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/graduatecollege-success/home/thesis-and-dissertation-information/). Moreover, you can find the BSU Microsoft Word and Google Doc templates [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/graduatecollege-success/thesis-and-dissertation-template/), and you can find standard formatting instructions [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/graduatecollege-success/thesis-and-dissertation-formatting-requirements/).

If you are a Computer Science major, you can find the CS Master's thesis template from Amit Jain [here](https://github.com/BoiseState/thesis-dissertation-template).

The template contained in this [GitHub](https://github.com) repository is a generic template meeting the most recent [Boise State University](http://www.boisestate.edu) thesis format requirements (ca. Spring 2024). If you have questions or run into problems with the format, please open an [issue](https://github.com/dylanmikesell/BSU_LaTeX_Thesis_Template/issues).

To run the example LaTeX and build a sample thesis, go to the src/ folder and run

`$ make`

This will run _pdflatex_, compile your _bibtex_, and leave you with a pdf file (BSUmain.pdf). You can open this with any pdf viewer of your choice.

If you're looking for help on LaTeX I suggest starting [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) or type your question into a web search. There are tons of LaTeX introductions out there on the web as well as user forums where others have probably asked your question many times before.
